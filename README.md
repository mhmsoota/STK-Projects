This virtual training series follows three (3) important design aspects of designing, developing, implementing, and launching a 1U CubeSat to image and characterize active volcanoes in the United States:

Orbit Design
Solar and Power Design
Communications Design
The CubeSat orbit is constrained between 0 and 90 degrees inclination and 250 to 550 km altitude. The satellite will house an imager capable of taking images of steam emissions, airborne ash, and lava flows from the volcanoes to provide early indications of eruption. We will use a ground station at AGI headquarters to monitor and command the mission.
